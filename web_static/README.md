AirBnB clone - Web static

  Description
This project show the built step by step of a basic front-end web application, here I learned how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of a page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of your page, the design. We are encouraged to fix our HTML part before starting the styling. Because, without any structure, we canâ€™t apply any design.
